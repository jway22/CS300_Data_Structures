Assignments from CS300 Data Analysis and Design

Qustions for reflection:

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The main problem that was being focused on over this course was how to take information and store it into various data structures. We worked on vectors, linked lists, hash tables, and binary search trees.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

By creating smaller programs that were mostly written out, we were able to focus on writing the code specifically for the data structure. Each data structure took time to review and understand how each one worked. It was necessary to figure out what methods were needed in order to make them function properly.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

My biggest struggle working on the project was that the parsing function that was created for previous assignments didn't work well with the .csv files we were now using. Becuase of this I needed to write out a new parsing function, which I haven't done for a few classes. With my professor's help, I was able to get it functioning properly.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

I can now create a data structure that can store information and sort it. This is very important for programs as a lot of programs for businesses need a function to store and sort information. This can be used in many other applications as well, and makes it easier to store than just creating a bunch of variables to store information.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I think anytime a program is worked on a programmer is improving these attributes. By writing the code and reviewing it you can test which lines are necessary. Then you can look at how each section works, and try to reduce how much code is there while still getting the same functionality. Finally, by learning to work with data structures, such as binary search trees which I chose for my final project, I was able to reuse a lot of code from my earlier assignment as the functionality is the same. I updated as necessary and changed variable names to fit the new program.
